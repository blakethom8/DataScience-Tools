# FORMS: Creating Forms 
  Django has a form class that makes it much easier to create forms

  from django import Forms


class LeadModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Lead             #add the model that this will relate to
        fields = (                 
          "first_name",         # display these fields in the actual form
            "last_name",
            "age",
            "agent"
        )

# NAMESPACE: 
  use name space to define URLs rather than hard code them, keeps you from having to go into all of the templates with the links
# TEMPLATES:
  Make sure to set up the templates in base project settings... [ BASE_DIR / "templates" ]
